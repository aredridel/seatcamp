# seatcamp

A web-based ephemeral chat site that lets users send simple, short messages
along with a 2-second video of themselves.

The offical server can be found at [https://chat.meatspac.es](https://chat.meatspac.es)

## Features

- Send a message to anyone connected to the same seatcamp server
- Provides jpeg (filmstrip-style) videos alongside chats, which tend to be
  more efficient to display than videos used in meatspace-chat-v2 (h264
  videos are provided for legacy clients)
- No signup required, but users receive a unique ID on first visit (displayed
  to users as an identicon alongside messages).
- Allows for muting users based on their ID, removing all their current
  messages and blocking any future ones
- Performs extremely minimal DOM element creation and recycles message
  elements, meaning the page loads quickly and is quite stable over long
  periods of time.

## Running a server

### Required software

seatcamp requires [node](https://nodejs.org) >=10.0.0 and ffmpeg in order to
work. Node can be downloaded its [official site](https://nodejs.org). ffmpeg can
generally be installed from your OS's package manager, or from source.
Examples of installing it:

**OSX**

```bash
$ brew install ffmpeg --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-theora --with-tools
```

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Configuring your server

Server configuration is handled through a JSON file: `conf.json`.

`conf.json-example` in the main directory will often provide all you need
for a development server, so for most developers, you can simply do:

```bash
$ cp conf.json-example conf.json
```

This will set you up with a server running on port `3456` over HTTP.

The server can then be run with:

```bash
$ npm start
```

If you are running a production seatcamp server, or simply want to
customize your development environment, you can change a few options in
`conf.json`. The options are:

### Normal options

#### port

The port to run the HTTP server on for this instance.

**Ex:** `"port": 3000`

#### host

The host or IP to run the HTTP server on for this instance. If left unspecified, it will listen on all interfaces.

**Ex:** `"host": "127.0.0.1"`

#### idKey

The key to use for hashing user ID's. This allows users to be given a
stable, unique ID per browser, but not expose their actual fingerprint
to other users on the server or be able to track users across seatcamp
instances. This value should be unique to the server you're running it
on and sufficiently long (10+ characters recommended).

**Ex:** `"idKey": "thisServerIsGreat123"`

#### gaTrackingId

The tracking ID to use for Google Analytics tracking. If this isn't
specified (or is a falsy value), Analytics will not be utilized.

**Ex:** `"gaTrackingId": "UA-9999999-1"`

## Requirements for production servers

Using a webcam from websites requires HTTPS (except for local addresses). The
seatcamp server does not provide direct support for HTTPS, under the expectation
that this will be handled better at a different layer. There are a variety of
TLS termination applications to choose from that will work well for this
purpose, such as [nginx](https://nginx.org/) or
[HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/).

## Protocol

The protocol of seatcamp is built around socket.io, making use of binary frames where appropriate.

### Connecting

Upon connecting, clients must send a fingerprint to the server. This fingerprint should uniquely
identify a particular client, and be relatively stable. Examples of good choices for this would be
a hardware identifier (e.g. Android ID), or a fingerprint constructed from many data points that
don't change often (e.g. fingerprintjs). Bad choices are things like IP addresses, since these could
potentially change a lot, as well as collide for multiple users.

To send the fingerprint, clients simply emit a `fingerprint` message with the fingerprint data as
the body, i.e.

```javascript
io.emit('fingerprint', 'myCoolFingerprint')
```

The server will reply with a `userid` message containing the ID it has calculated for this client,
which should be saved so that a client can recognize which messages are its own. This ID will be
constant for the lifetime of the websocket connection. An example of handling the message would be:

```javascript
io.on('userid', function(userId) {
  myId = userId
})
```

Clients should then specify what type of video they would like to receive by joining a channel. They
may do this using the `join` message:

```javascript
io.emit('join', 'jpg')
```

At present, the server supports two video types: `jpg` (vertically-stacked JPEG filmstrip) or
`h264`.

### Messages

Messages are transmitted to clients using the `chat` message. The format of the data passed in this
message is:

```javascript
{
  "video": ArrayBuffer(),
  "videoType": "jpg",
  "videoMime": "image/jpeg",
  "key": "AUniqueIdForTheMessage",
  "text": "The text the user sent",
  "sent": 1421135370231,
  "userId": "TheUserIDOftheSender",
  "from": "seatcamp"
}
```

`videoType` and `videoMime` will change based on what video format you subscribed to. `sent` is a
unix timestamp corresponding to when the message was originally sent. `from` specifies what server
the message originated from (and can currently only be `seatcamp`).

Clients can send messages by sending a `chat` message themselves, with the first parameter in the
following format:

```json
{
  "text": "The text the user wants to send",
  "format": "image/jpeg",
  "ack": "AUniqueIdTheServerShouldAckWith"
}
```

Clients should send an array of 10 frames (as binary) as the second parameter, e.g.

```javascript
io.emit('chat', message, frames)
```

`format` specifies what format these frames are in. At present, only `image/jpeg` is accepted. If
`ack` is specified, the server will send a response message containing the ID given, allowing
clients to find out if specific messages succeeded or failed. Acks are transmitted via an `ack`
message, formatted as:

```json
{
  "key": "AckIdThatWasSpecified",
  "err": "An error message (if applicable)"
}
```

If `err` is not set, the message sending succeeded.

### Status updates

The server will send clients a number of different status updates to allow things like user counts
to be known. These are all handled through seperate messages, which are:

#### active

Specifies how many users are currently connected.

```javascript
io.on('active', function(numActive) {
  alert('There are ' + numActive + ' active seatcamp users!')
})
```

## Contributing

seatcamp is written using ES6-compliant JavaScript, compiled to ES5 using babel. Client-side code
is similarly written, but compiled with `browserify` and `babelify`. Contributions should attempt to
make use of ES6 features where they make sense. Pull requests are accepted and will be looked at in
a timely manner. If you are contributing a new feature (rather than a bug fix), its a good idea to
open a PR early to discuss the viability of that feature in the larger ecosystem before you attempt
to write code for it.

New features will be accepted if they fortify/enhance behavior that developed from the community
(e.g. hashtags on Twitter), but will likely be denied if they are something completely outside of
the way the community uses the site.
